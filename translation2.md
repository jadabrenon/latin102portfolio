Translation:
Deianira, the wife of Hercules, could not cross the great river, which was named Evenus, and the centaur Nessus, who was the son of Ixion and Nubes, she asked him for help. After she had been carried up in the river itself he wanted to rape her. When Hercules came to this place and when Deianira implored his help, he pierced Nessus with his arrows.

As he was dying, when he knew that the arrows had great potency because they had been soaked in posinous liquid of the Hydra Lerna, he gave his own blood to Deiaira after it has been removed and he said that it was a love potion.



**B. Grammatical questions**

1. Identify the antecedent of cui, and its gender and number. Then explain what case cui is, and how it functions in the relative clause. (I.e., why is cui in this case?)

It is a relative pronoun and the antecedent is magnum (neuter, singular). It matches magnum in gender and number but uses the dative case (winner/loser) and can be possessive as well.

2. Identify the form of transire. Explain why you placed it in the clause you chose.

It is the present active infinitive of transeo (2nd principle part) being used in a direct statment.

3. Sublatam is from a verb that is a compound of sub plus a verb you should know very well. Identify the form of this participle (which for participles means: gender, case, number, tense voice). Find the dictionary entry for this word in thed Lewis-Short’s Latin Dictionary, and give its URN here.

The dictionary entry is ferō, ferre, tulī, lātus - to bear, carry, bring (4th principle part - perfect passive particple) and it matches Deianira (accustive and feminine). urn:markdown:n17964

4. Identify the form of sagittis. Why does Hyginus use this case?

It is dative, plural, and feminine. Dative case is used because he is trying to use it to express possesion with the dative (i.e "with the arrows").

5. Identify the form of moriens.

Present active participle of morior.

6. Identify felle. Why does Hyginus use this case?

It is neuter and ablative. Ablative is used because it is the "do it all" case. The arrows were soaked "in posonous liquid."

7. Identify the form of tinctas.

Accusative plural perfect passive participle

8. Identify the form of exceptum.

9. William Faulkner’s novel As I lay dying takes its title from an English translation of a single word in Odyssey 11.424. In Greek, where participles function very differently from English but similarly to Latin, that word is a present active participle. Suggest one or more possible translations of Faulkner’s title into Latin.

Moriens
