Cum Deinira, filia Oeni et uxor Herculis, vidisset Lolen iuvenem bellam adductam esse, Deianira coepiebat machinari ne privaretur marito.

Deinira misit famulum ad ferendum Herculem vestimentum mundavisse in sanguinem centauri Nessi, quam putaverit philtrum.

Hercules vestem induit et hunc statim in flammatum. 

Hercules iecit famulum, quem Deianira misit ferre vestimentum, in maren.

Herculem immortalitatem desurrexit, sed Deinara ea interfecit ob actum.
