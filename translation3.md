Glossary and notes

Note: the verb sum, esse, fui, futurus has no present participle! If you want to construct the equivalent of a normal verbal unit using a participle with a noun, you can simply omit the verb “to be” and include the predicate (just as you can with finite forms of sum: Herculis fortis could be a complete sentence). This is most easily recognizable when the noun is an ablative in ablative absolute construction.

Vocabulary:

- Augeas, Augeae (m), Augeas, king of Elis

- bobile, bobilis (n), “stall”

- caro, carnis (f), “flesh, meat”

- Iuppiter, Iovis (m), Jupiter

- purgo, purgare, purgavi, purgatus, “to clean (something, from something else)” Note that purgo can take two accusative direct objects.

- quattuor (indeclinable adj.), “four”

- stercus, stercoris (n), “dung, manure”

A. Grammatical analysis Place each verbal idea (clause, indirect statement, participial expression) on a separate line, indented to show its level of subordination. Italicize the verb of each unit by surrounding it with asterisks.

Augeae regis stercus bobile uno die *purgavit*,
> maiorem partem Iove *adiutore*;

flumine admisso totum stercus *abluit*.
> taurum cum quo Pasiphae *concubuit*

ex Creta insula Mycenis vivum *adduxit*.

Diomedem Thraciae regem et equos quattuor eius,

> qui carne humana *vescebantur*,

> cum Abdero famulo *interfecit*;

equorum autem nomina Podargus Lampon Xanthus Dinus.

B. Grammatical questions

1. In the phrase, Iove adiutore, what case is Iove? What kind of construction is this phrase

Iove is in the ablative case and it is the absolute ablative.

2. What case is stercus, and why is it in that case?

Stercus is in the nominative case (subject).

3. Identify the form of the adjective maiorem (gender, case, number, degree).

Feminine, accustaive, singular, comparative.

4. Explain the construction of the verbal unit flumine admisso.

It is the ablative absolute.

5. What are the gender, number, case, and antecedent of qui?

Qui is in the masculine, plural, nominative and its antecedent is equos.

6. What Latin verb form has to be understood in the clause that runs from equorum to Dinus?

The latin verb "to be" has no present participle so it is omitted from the sentence but the sentence is still complete.

C. Literary commentary

Choose two choices of syntax, word order, or diction that Hyginus makes in this passage that complement or enhance the meaning of the passage’s content. Discuss briefly s in 3-4 sentences. Italicize Latin words when citing them.

The passage is enhanced by diction when Hyginus names each of the individual horses, which suggests just how difficult it was for Hercules to kill each and every one of them. Also, Hyginus uses the irregular comparitive of *maiorem* which allows us to conclude that Jupiter helped him clean the stall for the majority of the time. This choice helps us achieve a much stronger awareness of the situation as it indicates just how much Jupiter helped in cleaning the manure.
