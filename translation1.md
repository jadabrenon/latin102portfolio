When Hercules came in hospitality to King Dexamenus and deflowered his daughter, he wanted to lead her as a wife.

When Hercules was absent, the Centaur, Eurytion, demanded Deinariam as his wife. 

Since the father feared the centaur, he promised her to him. 

At a certain time, the centaurs and brothers came to the marriage. Hercules intervened and killed the centaurs, and carried off Deianiram.
