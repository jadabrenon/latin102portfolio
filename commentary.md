**Option B**

Compare a passage of Hyginus with an illutration of the same subject in art. Identify the work of art, and cite at least two specific points in Hyginusâ€™ Latin that are similar to or different from the visual illustration.

**Hyginus, chapter 30, section 2**

"Leonem Nemeum, quem Luna nutrierat in antro amphistomo atrotum, necauit, cuius pellem pro tegumento habuit."

Hercules killed the Nemeum Lion, whom Luna nourished in the cave

**Work of art: Reconstruction of metope from Temple of Zeus, Olympia**

One similarity is that the picture does show Hercules standing on top of a dead Nemeum Lion, which is what this section describes. One difference, however, is that it is unclear that they were in a cave, and judging from the floor they look like they're in a building of some sort. Also, there is no indication of the nourishing that Luna did. These are some key differences between Hyginus, chapter 30, section 2 and the "Reconstruction of metope from Temple of Zeus, Olympia."
